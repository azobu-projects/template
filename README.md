## Inspirations

This project is inspired by:

- [Material Design Kit](https://materialdesignkit.com)
- [RealWorld.io](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)
  - [`react-redux-realworld`](https://github.com/gothinkster/react-redux-realworld-example-app)
  - [`node-express-realworld`](https://github.com/gothinkster/node-express-realworld-example-app)
- [React.js Boilerplate](https://reactboilerplate.com)
- [Express application generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html)

But instead of taking different programming ecosystem at once, Template is made to be highly opiniated for just around JavaScript and Node.js because the main goal is to be a quick starter kit.

Ultimately this base application is adapted into other apps:

- [The Galactic News](https://thegalacticnews.azobu.com) news portal
- [Earthling](https://earthling.azobu.com) social media
- [Planetary](https://planetary.azobu.com) job board
- [Jankenpon](https://jankenpon.azobu.com) rock-paper-scissors game

Actively updated too during 2020, unlike the others which already stopped more than 2 years.
